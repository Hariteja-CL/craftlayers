Mission: Update my GitHub repo by replacing the entire website with my new clean rebuild, but do it safely using a feature branch workflow.

Hard rules (must follow)

Do NOT push to main at any time.

Work only on branch: Gravity-branch.

No force-pushes. No history rewrite.

The goal is a full replacement of the current repo content with the new build.

Steps to execute

Connect to GitHub repo: Hariteja-CL/craftlayers.

Fetch and pull the latest main (read-only reference).

Checkout (or create if missing) branch: Gravity-branch from main.

Replace everything in the repo with my new rebuild:

Remove existing pages/components/assets that are part of the old site.

Keep only essential repo files like .gitignore, README.md (update if needed).

Ensure the project is React component-based and production-ready.

Validate locally before committing:

Install dependencies

Run build successfully

Ensure homepage renders and routes load (no blank page)

Commit with message:

reset: replace site with clean rebuild

Push changes to 
design updates = Design-changes/*  branch
New blogs = Blog/* branch
New case study = Case study/* branch
