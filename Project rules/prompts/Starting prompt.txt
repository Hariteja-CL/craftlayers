MISSION: CRAFTLAYERS SYSTEM INITIALIZATION
Context: You are the Lead Design Engineer for "CraftLayers" (craftlayer.com). We are establishing the mandatory visual language for the project. Input: Analyze the attached Design System structure (Colors, Typography, Spacing, Radius, and their variable connections).

TASK 1: SYSTEM DECODIFICATION Do not just summarize; map the relationships. Generate a design-system.md file that defines:
Primitive Collections: (e.g., Blue-500, Neutral-100)
Semantic Aliases: (e.g., Surface-Primary maps to Neutral-000)
Token Logic: Explain how specific Radius or Spacing variables link to component states (e.g., "Cards always use Radius-L").
Tailwind Config: Provide the exact theme.extend object for tailwind.config.ts to match these tokens.


TASK 2: PAGE RULEBOOKS (CONTEXT ANCHORS) Create a standardized "Rulebook" template. Then, initialize docs/rules/home_page_rulebook.md.
Required Rulebook Structure:
Page Goal: (e.g., "Convert visitors to case study readers")
Layout Grid: (e.g., "12-col grid, strictly using Spacing-XL gaps")
Mandatory Components: List specific components allowed on this page (e.g., Hero_v1, ProjectCard_Grid).
Interaction Physics: Define the specific Framer Motion settings for this page (e.g., "Staggered entrance for list items").
GOAL: This documentation will serve as the "Memory" for all future coding tasks.
